                                                      Publisher




1. create public key k1
2. request public key from the provider k2
3. receive the public key from the provider k2
4. create and sign a non-broad casted transaction T1 as follows:
  1. sets up a payment of Zencoins to the output.
  2. (2b) provider privete-key is required k2'.
  3. publisher private-key is required k1'.

5. create a refund transaction T2 that is connected to the output of T1, which send the Zencoins
   back to the publisher, as follows:
  1. define Time Lock to T2.
  2. don't sign the transaction T2.
  3. send a copy of T2 to the provider.

6. (2b) Receive the signed transaction T2.
7. verify the provider signature private-key in T2, else abort the contract.
8. Sign the transaction T1.
9. broad cast the transaction T1 to the provider or to the output.
10. (3) create a transaction T3 as follows:
  1. T3 connects to T1 on the block chain DB in the same manner as T2 does connect to T1 output.
  2. T3 has two outputs as follows:
      1. one output points to k1 .
      2. one output points to k2 .
  3. T3 starts with all values allocated to the first  output as T2 does, but T3 is not time locked.
  4. Sign T3 transaction.
  5. Send T3 transaction to the provider.

11. (4b)Pay by adjust T3 copy to allocate more value to the provider output and less to own value.
12. Resign the adjusted copy of T3 with a new .
